# Neural-Machine-Translation

Neural machine translation uses neural networks to translate source text to target text, and neural networks can work with very large datasets and require little supervision. Neural machine translation systems have two main sections: an encoder network and a decoder network. Both are neural networks.

This repositary contains codes for different methods of Neural Machine Translation along with the link to their papers.
